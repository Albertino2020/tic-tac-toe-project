## Getting Started

### About the Game 

    Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players.

    The players are identified by their respective symbols 'X' (cross) and 'O' (nought).

    For this reason, this game is also called noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os.

    The players take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. 

    The player who first succeeds in placing three of his/her mark in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, wins the match.

    If all the spaces in the grid are marked and none of the playes can win, the match is drawn.

    This is an implamentation of the tic-tac-toe game in Ruby.

    To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
